   ```

## Data Acquisition
Data for sentiment analysis is acquired from Twitter using the Twitter API. A specific search query is used to gather relevant tweets.

## Data Processing and Cleaning
The tweet text is processed using tokenization and stop word removal. This step ensures that the data is cleaned and ready for sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis Implementation
Sentiment analysis is performed using the TextBlob library. The sentiment polarity of each processed tweet is calculated.

## Results Visualization
The results are visualized through a histogram, showcasing the distribution of sentiment polarity in the analyzed tweets.

## Project Explanation
This project demonstrates the application of sentiment analysis in analyzing social media sentiments. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step explanation of data acquisition, cleaning, sentiment analysis, and visualization.
